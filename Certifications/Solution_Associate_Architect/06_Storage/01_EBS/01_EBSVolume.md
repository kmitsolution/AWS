### **What is EBS?**

**Amazon Elastic Block Store (EBS)** is a scalable, high-performance, and durable block-level storage service designed to be used with Amazon EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud) instances. EBS volumes provide persistent storage that remains intact even after an EC2 instance is stopped, terminated, or rebooted, making them ideal for applications that require a database, file system, or other forms of structured data storage.

### **Key Features of EBS:**

1. **Persistent Storage:**
   - EBS volumes provide persistent storage that can be attached to EC2 instances. Data stored in EBS remains available even after EC2 instances are stopped or terminated. You can create backups of your volumes using snapshots, which are stored in Amazon S3.

2. **Used with EC2 Instances:**
   - EBS volumes are designed to be attached to EC2 instances for use as a primary storage device. They function as virtual hard drives that can hold an operating system, application data, or databases. EC2 instances can access EBS volumes directly over the network, enabling fast and reliable access to stored data.

3. **High Availability and Durability:**
   - Amazon EBS volumes are designed for high availability. They are automatically replicated within their Availability Zone (AZ) to protect data from hardware failures. EBS offers **99.999% durability** and is engineered to be resistant to failure, providing a reliable data storage solution for critical workloads.
   - **Snapshots** can be created for volumes to back up your data and are stored in Amazon S3, which also offers high durability and availability.

### **Additional Key Features:**

- **Scalability:**
  - EBS volumes can be easily resized (increased in size or performance) without stopping the EC2 instance. This flexibility allows you to scale up your storage capacity and performance as needed.

- **Performance:**
  - EBS offers multiple volume types, each optimized for different performance needs:
    - **General Purpose SSD (gp3, gp2)** for balanced price and performance.
    - **Provisioned IOPS SSD (io2, io1)** for high-performance applications requiring high IOPS.
    - **Throughput Optimized HDD (st1)** and **Cold HDD (sc1)** for throughput-intensive and archival storage use cases.

- **Encryption:**
  - EBS supports encryption both at rest and in transit. Volumes are encrypted using AWS Key Management Service (KMS) by default, ensuring secure data storage without the need for additional configuration.

- **Snapshot Management:**
  - You can create incremental snapshots of EBS volumes. These snapshots can be used for backup, disaster recovery, and cloning volumes across regions. Snapshots only save the changes made since the last snapshot, optimizing storage costs.

- **Cost-Effective:**
  - With flexible pricing options, you only pay for the storage you use. EBS also offers **provisioned IOPS** for high-performance applications, which ensures predictable performance while allowing you to control costs.

- **Elasticity:**
  - The "elastic" aspect of EBS means you can quickly and easily add storage or change volume types to adapt to changing workload demands.

In summary, **Amazon EBS** is a robust and scalable block-level storage service designed to integrate seamlessly with EC2 instances. It offers persistent, high-performance, and secure storage, making it an essential component for running scalable applications and managing critical data in the cloud.
